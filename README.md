# Will Estony's Internship Application: Full-Stack

## What is it?

Using Cloudflare Workers, this application randomly sends the user to one of two urls. 
This project utilizes the following JavaScript tools and capabilities:


- [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/quickstart/)
- [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
- [HTMLRewriter](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/apis/html-rewriter/)
- [Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)

The variant urls have been updated with links to my personal website and my top 5 favorite movies.
Additionally, the app uses a permanent cookie to persist which url is chosen until August 11, 2020 
(my birthday). 

## Useful Links

The app can be viewed at two different locations:

- [Workers Dev](https://fullstack_challenge_estony-staging.williamestony.workers.dev)
- [Personal Domain](https://fulllstack.browdiegram.us)
